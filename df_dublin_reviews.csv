Dublin Airport T2 just now [10-Sep-2022 12:30] 
"Dublin airport is now my favv airport by far! 
Im in Dublin quite often and the passport control is one of the best in all of the airports ive been to ‚ù§Ô∏è quick ins and puts, friendly banter and no grumpy faces - this is not the norm for a third world country national travelling in europe! (Also no passport control when you leave the country!)

My only gripe with the airport was the security lines ( yes i experienced the nightmarish ones from last year). But today,  i experienced the magic that is the new security check at dublin airport - no cumbersome removal and display of almost every item in my bag anymore - keep your packed bag in the tray and walk on in! (Do we know how and why - i want to send a thank you letter to whoever made this happen!)"
Dublin Airport this morning.This city really can't handle more people.

"6h layover in Dublin airport Good day all, we have a 6h layover in Dublin and was wondering do you reckon we have time to get out to Dublin by train/bus(?) and possibly visit a pub/eat lunch? Also if you have any suggestions gor a quick must see before returning to the airport any tips are appreciated. 

All the best, thank you!"
Connect the bleeding DART to the airport I seriously don‚Äôt understand why our government don‚Äôt look at expanding the dart line to the airport from Malahide. It has been talked about in the past as an alternative to the metro. It would be great to serve the coastal areas of Dublin and Wicklow. It would work perfectly with the metro and also the new dart lines that will be built.
"Dublin Airport Noise Edit: sorry if I sound formal üòÖ

Recently there has been a lot of discussions about the situation over noise at Dublin airport. I want to get your views on it? 

Background:
Dublin Airport is the islands largest airport and is the home base of both Aer Lingus and Ryanair. Recently, the airport celebrated their busiest ever day with 120,585 passengers on July 30th. 

The airport recently opened up its third operational runway. Named ‚ÄúNorth Runway‚Äù (28R/10L), it has been proven to be a necessity for the growth of the aviation industry in Ireland. However when planning was granted by Fingal County Council (FCC), it was given a few restrictions. 

Restrictions:
North Runway shall not be used for whatsoever between 11pm and 7am. There will be a cap of 65 on aircraft movements at night. 

Impact:
Heavy reduction on flights at the airport resulting in flight cancellations and delays. And clear loss of revenue for the airport. 

Although newer planes such as the A321NEO LR and the A320NEO (both operated by Aer Lingus) and the Boeing 737MAX8 (Ryanair), noise will be reduced significantly. 

I understand the residents have to live with the constant noise of planes but I want to get your views. Thanks in advance :) 

You can view documents by FCC & DAA here:
[FCC](https://file:///private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/C81FECC7-9837-4347-B96D-84FB6E92FFC9/Documents/Inbox/20210210-anca-recommendation-report-.pdf)

Had an absolute nightmare at Dublin airport today... Arrived 3 1/2 hours before my flight and got through security in like 10 minutes so now I have lots of time to kill. Already had a coffee and too early for a pint. Absolute nightmare. DAA have a lot to answer for
"Anyone find the food options in the airport to be fairly crap? You‚Äôve got that Burger King that will probably be where the next global pandemic originates from and next to it that pub/restaurant that charges about 20 quid for some toast and a coffee. And a few smaller places downstairs. 

Bring back the McD‚Äôs where the Burger King is now I say!"
"Dublin Airport Noise It‚Äôs now 7am and I find myself awake for the past 2 hours from a constant noise from Dublin airport. 
I‚Äôm not one for complaining and have lived within a 10min drive from Dublin airport all my life so I‚Äôm used to the noise from aircraft and it never really bothered me. 
Since the opening of the new runway the noise has been incredible sometimes louder than others and it‚Äôs no exaggeration when I say sometimes the house feels like it‚Äôs shaking the house. I know this comes with living beside the airport and it never bothered me before but it‚Äôs been so bad recently that we had to invest in new windows and doors to try and help cut out the noise it did help a bit but there is no escaping the noise. 
The reason I write this is because this morning the noise is different. It‚Äôs not like every few minutes you here a different plane take off and the level goes up and down. It feels like its a constant drone of aircraft engines roaring non stop and it is really bugging me. I don‚Äôt usually let things that I can‚Äôt control get to me but this is just crazy. The only answer I can think of is the drastic decision of moving. 
 The area we live in is really nice the kids are settled in school and play on local sporting teams everything we need is close by but because of my lack of sleep I cannot function during the day and quality of life has drastically decreased. 
We cannot afford nor do we want to move but I don‚Äôt see any other options at the moment. 
 I‚Äôm clutching at straws here but hoping that someone in the know can tell me that it‚Äôs unusual airport activity lately causing more noise than usual and it‚Äôs going to quiet down soon or come up with some other answers to change my mind on making a decision that will disrupt my family."
If Dublin airport wasn‚Äôt already in enough of a mess 
"Airport rant - bringing coffee on board I'm quite often in Dublin Airport and so far have found it quite easy to navigate with the people working there quite nice and helpful.
I'm taking a flight to Brussels at 7 am and need my coffee. I travel around once a month and usually I buy a coffee before getting on board. 
Upon boarding pass/ID verification the guy first doubts if my Belgian ID is an ID... Fair enough, maybe he's new to the job, I thought. Then he proceeds to inform me I cannot bring my coffee on board because it's not allowed. I told him I do it regularly and have had no issues before. In short, he made me throw the coffee I had just bought out and when I got to the plane the stewardess informed me this was not correct, they have no problem with coffee. Now I'm on a plane before 7am, without coffee and in a worse mood than when I woke up at 4h30. 

Why do some people like to mess up other's days..."
Dublin airport at 5:40? I‚Äôm taking a trip to Brussels to see a friend but am having trouble deciding which airport. I live in cork and the airport there will only take me to Amsterdam at which point I‚Äôd need a train. However if I take a train to Dublin I can fly directly to Brussels and skip that hassle. How busy is Dublin airport on a Saturday at 5? I‚Äôm fully prepared to arrive 3 hours early but was wondering what I should expect.
"DUBLIN AIRPORT LOST LUGGAGE- Aer Lingus lost my luggage in Dublin airport I was travelling from JFK to Dublin and apparently my bag made it to Dublin airport but didn‚Äôt come out on the carousel. I tried calling the airline which has been absolutely useless and unhelpful (3 days have gone by and no update or help of any kind) my work laptop and all my clothes are in that bag and I told them I URGENTLY need it. The Dublin Airport has not answered any of my calls, at this point I think they‚Äôre ignoring them on purpose from everyone. As I‚Äôm out of options I‚Äôm considering travelling up there to hopefully get some assistance, does anyone know if that will help? Does anyone have any alternative numbers I can call or anything I can try? I live far so travelling up there is only an option if I know it will help. Any advice at all would be so welcome!"

"Traveling from and to Dublin Airport Hi guys, hope you are doing well. 

I just got a job at Dublin Airport, and was wondering, how do most people travel from and to Dublin Airport? Okay, in the daytime, it's not a problem, because of the frequent departures of city bus.

I will be working all sorts of shifts because airport works 24/7, so in the night time there is only Dublin Express that goes frequently, and it costs 8-10‚Ç¨. Whitch is a bit pricey if you travel every day.

I couldn't find online, are there any discounts for airport staff, or any other cheaper alternatives? (I live in Dublin 1 btw.)

Thank you all for your help!"

"Thank you Dublin Airport Security The other day I was collecting my son from terminal 2. I had parked in the multi-story but when I went to pay, I realised I had lost my parking ticket. 

It was 9pm on a Saturday night so not that many people around. I thought I'd have to pay some exhorbitant fee to get out. I pressed the help button on the pay machine and a lovely security guard asked my reg number and in a few seconds a pay amount showed on the screen. I was 3 minutes over the 1 hour period so the price was something like ‚Ç¨7. He said wait a minute, don't pay that. A few seconds later ‚Ç¨3 showed up on screen. 

I paid it, got a new ticket and off I went

Just wanted to say what could have been a stressful expensive experience was resolved in a friendly efficient way and I even got money off. Fair play lads."
"Where to view aircraft at Dublin Airport I have three year old twins obsessed with the airport and aircraft. Seems the last place to view aircraft from *within* the airport (next to the bar/pub thing in T1) is now a staff eating area.
Is there anywhere *inside Dublin Airport* to view aircraft from within the building without going through security?
(Before anyone says it, I know it's far better to park along the perimeter fence. But that won't fly with these two)
Thank you!

EDIT: Need to be inside the airport."

"Charged ‚Ç¨68 going from Islandbridge to Dublin airport on FreeNow The charge was more than on the meter and far more than the app estimate.
He took the M50 which is apparently charged by distance instead of time but the price is still ridiculous. There was no traffic anywhere on the trip and we didn't hit red lights.
Any one experience anything like this? I've reported it to FreeNow to try to get it reduced.

Update: I complained to FreeNow and they refunded ‚Ç¨20 because it was so much above the usual price."

"Airport Question Hi all! I'm heading to Ireland from the states soon for a third time as part of a super extended family reunion. Since my last visit I've become an avid cyclist and intend to bring a bicycle with me. 

If possible: I'm hoping to pack everything in an Evoc bike box and leave the box in Dublin while I ride from town-to-town while my family drives the rental car. 

Is there any sort of baggage storage at the airport that is secure? Would need to be for about a week. 

Any other creative solutions if not? Maybe calling LBS's to ask for the favor is my only other thought. 

PS: If you have any ""must see"" segments of roads or tips for me I'd embrace them! Thanks! "

Looking at the Flight Radar it seems like flights are taking off more or less OK, but bunch of planes are circling around Dublin having troubles to land.

Anyone is flying today? Are flights being delayed/cancelled? Looking at the deparurea board on the website it looks like flights are in time, but usually those boards can be very misleading."

"Early morning transport options Dublin Airport Hi!

We're a family of 8 adults and 2 children traveling from Dublin 7 to Dublin Airport for a 7 AM flight on a weekday.

We're wondering whether to take the 41 bus, the Dublin Express, or a taxi if we want to leave at around 3 AM for the airport.

I've read that the 41 runs 24 hours and is pretty reliable. We can walk to the stop or take a bus there. We will each have a carry-on size bag, but we're worried about it being overcrowded at 3 or 4 AM. 

I've seen mixed reviews about the Dublin Express and pre-ordering taxis, mostly that the Dublin Express is not always reliable or oversold and pre-ordered taxi drivers may not show up.

What, do you think, is the best option we have for getting to the airport early of the three? Thanks in advance!"

"Walking from the Dublin Airport to the city center? I‚Äôm planning to attend a retreat in Kiltegan in Co. Wicklow in July 2023. The romantic in me wants to walk there from the airport. I‚Äôd at least plan to walk the Wicklow Way starting in Marley Park, but I‚Äôm curious what you thought about walking from the airport. Are there routes you‚Äôd encourage or discourage?

I‚Äôm a large, tall male planning to travel with one backpack if that influences your responses.

Edit: I should also mention I‚Äôm a walker. I average 11 km per day, more in the summer.

Edit: Thank you all for the recommendations. I have some time before I make a decision, but the consensus seems to be that it‚Äôs doable and safe, with footpaths the whole way, but the scenery would be of a boring industrial area for the first hour.

A few commenters have pointed me towards other walking routes by the sea in Howth or the cliff walk from Bray to Greystones. These are great suggestions! I did spend about four months in Dublin as a student with a DART pass, and have several of these walks to thank for my learning to love walking. This isn‚Äôt my first time in Dublin. This won‚Äôt be my first impression of the area. it‚Äôs just one experience I‚Äôm considering. 

I‚Äôll admit, after a long flight there‚Äôs something appealing about rearranging my ultralight backpack and striking out to see where my feet can take me rather than queueing up for a bus. The scenery notwithstanding, I can‚Äôt picture a better way to spend those awkward few hours between the flight and when I can check into my accommodations."

I have also heard though from a few different people that they dont even ask or check for your covid vaccination proofs or certificates at pre clearance. a few different people have said they literally dont check at Dublin airport lol.

My question is - has anyone recently travelled from Dublin to US recently and can confirm that they dont check this?

"Luggage stuck in Dublin airport for three months- AirTag shows it‚Äôs behind a random door in arrivals hall. UPDATE: BAG RETURNED !!
Just wanted to give a bit of a surprising update and thank you all. Long story short I sent emails on Thursday  evening to multiple parties ( including DAA, Sky Handling Partners and Airline ) outlining the complete timeline as stated below. I also added at the end some of the terminology you guys mentioned in the comments ( including small claims court etc ) and mentioned going to the Guards to report property being withheld if nothing was done. 

Low and behold ‚Ä¶I suddenly get the bag back this morning , delivered to my door ! After three months I do not think it is a coincidence that it just so happened to be found right after the emails‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm slightly annoyed that I had to go the nuclear route to get something that was obviously very doable to happen - but at the end of the day I‚Äôm just happy to have finally gotten my stuff back !

I want to sincerely thank you all so much for all your advice , and reiterate one lesson from this mess: do not check a bag through Dublin airport if you can help it !!!

Hi all! Bit of a shot in the dark here but I‚Äôm at a loss what to do , if any of ye have any advice please let me know! 

Basically I took a flight to the US three months ago and the  checked baggage never even left Dublin airport ( know this because I have an AirTag in it ). Ok bit shit but not the end of the world , was three weeks in the US and it never arrived (lodged the usual ‚Äúmissing baggage‚Äù claim with airline , on the phone they said basically Dublin airport was a mess and it‚Äôs an issue with baggage handling- Sky handling partners ) Arrived back in Dublin and AirTag still showing it in airport - try to see if I can get it back but no one at gate at arrival who can help. 

Fast forward to today and another two months of being on hold. No update from airline other than they‚Äôre still searching. Even took a day off work and went up to the airport last week to try and talk to someone in person in the baggage handling company in person as I literally know it‚Äôs there. Turns out bag is still in Dublin airport but behind a ‚Äúrestricted access door‚Äù in arrivals hall that I have no access to - they basically said there‚Äôs nothing they can do, they can‚Äôt let me in and just to wait till my airline gets in touch. They said they‚Äôre working through each week to get bags out to their warehouse where they can be picked up - but obviously mine has, for whatever reason, not made it out yet. 

My question is , I know exactly where my bag is , am just not allowed to get it. Sounds dramatic but is this something I can go the gards over ? It‚Äôs been three months and they‚Äôre  essentially holding my property with no guarantee I‚Äôll ever get it back - and I‚Äôm sick of waiting on phone lines for nothing to be happening."

"Dublin Airport Wifi Hello redditors of Dublin,

I will be travelling to Dublin next month. Quite soon after my flight is about to land at DUB airport, I have a rather important video conference to be in. My safest bet is to do it in the airport because I will probably not make it to the hotel in time.

Does anyone know if the Dublin Airport Wifi is good enough for videocalls? Is there some better option to get online? Doesn't have to be free. Any help is appreciated."
"Dublin airport queues I'll be flying from Dublin to France soon and I want to know if 2 and a half hours is enough time to make my flight?

Thanks!"
"Grinder through airport security? Hi everyone. I live in the Netherlands and have been on vacation in Dublin! I love this beautiful city. I accidentally (stupidly) brought a marijuana grinder with me, because I forgot it was in my bag and it passed through airport security successfully in the Dutch airport. I was wondering if I can bring it back to the Netherlands without getting in trouble with airport security here in Dublin, or if I should just chuck it to avoid being detained‚Ä¶ Does anyone have any insight? Like, do you think I could just explain it as having accidentally brought it over from my country of residence where it‚Äôs legal? There‚Äôs hardly any weed in there, and if I do decide to bring it I would clean it out.

Update: it got through perfectly fine! Thanks everyone."

"Do I need transit visa in Dublin airport I‚Äôve been getting mixed answers from everyone. Also waiting to hear back from immigration dep.

So I‚Äôm buying tickets for my relatives from Vietnam -> Dubai -> Dublin-> Montreal (Canada). The tickets are all from Qatar Airways but the last leg of the flight is operated by Canada Air. They will be arriving in Dublin at 6:30am and leaving 10:45am at Terminal 1. Now when I checked immigration website I got the following information: 

Transit passengers making connections at Dublin Airport should be aware of the following: If both your arrival flight and onward connecting flight are in Terminal 2 between the hours of 04:00 and 16:00 on the same day, you can use a transit visa in this case. In all other situations you will need permission to enter the State (you will need to have the appropriate Irish entry visa if you are visa required for entry to Ireland).

My relatives have Vietnamese passports. Since they won‚Äôt arrive in Terminal 2, do they need ‚Äòpermission to enter state‚Äô, namely an Irish entry visa? I couldn‚Äôt fathom how this is the case as they would still be in the same terminal the whole time and won‚Äôt have to take out their luggage but they need a visa? Can anyone confirm this ‚òπÔ∏è?"

"How quickly can I get out of Dublin airport? Hi! Second last Friday of March I'm flying in with Ryanair - haven't picked my flight yet as I was wondering - say my plane touches down at 1630, I don't have any luggage to pick up and there's no unexpected event (strike, security risk) holding up arrivals, how long would it take me to get to Rotunda, where I'm staying? I walk fast, have a UK passport, and tend not to get too overwhelmed buying travel passes ;)

Thanks in advance.

**Update:** If anyone's invested in this little narrative (greatest story ever told), I've booked myself on a flight that gets in at 1130 instead.

"Help find my bags at Dublin Airport (‚Ç¨500 Reward) **Update 12 August**: I came home from work today and both bags were sitting on my front porch. Sounds like they were located a few days ago, but the airline never informed me (even now the tracking website still lists them as missing) so it was a complete surprise to see them there.  Thank you to everyone who helped out or commented. I appreciate all the help and you‚Äôre all proof the world is full of good people!


A couple weeks ago my girlfriend and I had a flight connection in Dublin. Our 2 checked bags never made it home, and the airlines still have no idea where either bag is. I have a feeling they didn‚Äôt make the connecting flight and are sitting somewhere in the Dublin airport.

Since I‚Äôm a long way from Dublin, I was hoping some intrepid redditors might try to help out. If anyone would be willing to visit the airport and look around the airline baggage offices for our bags, I‚Äôd be eternally grateful. And if you find them, and get them to an airport employee who can get them back to us, I‚Äôll send you ‚Ç¨250 per bag. Find one, your reward is ‚Ç¨250, find both and I‚Äôll give you ‚Ç¨500.

The bags: both are big teal backpacks, so they‚Äôre rather distinctive ‚Äî I‚Äôm not asking you to look for a black suitcase amongst a million other black suitcases. One is a Lowe Alpine Contour IV, and from the color was clearly purchased in the 1990‚Äôs. The other is an Osprey Ariel 75 in a more modern teal color.

Pictures here: https://imgur.com/a/5CIP3Lh

Some other details: our incoming flight was on SAS (terminal 1) and we departed on Aer Lingus in terminal 2. I have a feeling the bags never made it to Aer Lingus, so the SAS baggage office in terminal 1 might be a good place to start. Just to be clear though, I don‚Äôt know for sure they‚Äôre even in Dublin, but that seems the most likely place.

What if you find them? If they still have the airline‚Äôs bag tags attached, an employee should be able to scan the tags and find our information. If they don‚Äôt have the tags, DM me and I‚Äôll get back to you with some contact info and some details of their contents to positively identify them. And please send me a picture or two! Then we can work out payment details (~~Venmo~~ (I guess this isn‚Äôt an option), PayPal, bank transfer, whatever works).

Thank you very much for any help you can give!

(Using a throwaway because enough friends and coworkers have heard me bitching about my missing baggage and I don‚Äôt want them to find my main account)"
Baggage at Dublin Airport Hoping for clarification here as Dublin Airport seems to be insane. My luggage has been at the airport for 13-14 days at this point. I‚Äôve filed a claim with Eurowings and been in contact with United airlines since they flew me in to Dublin. United did not inform me that I needed to collect my luggage between my connecting flights. United says they‚Äôve contact the airport but with no follow up and Eurowings‚Ä¶well they don‚Äôt respond. Any chance that it‚Äôs taking an insane amount of time to scan the luggage that‚Äôs ‚Äúunclaimed‚Äù and will eventually get back to me?? Hoping for a miracle at this point and losing hope.

"Dublin Airport Parking Query Hey reddit, I'm flying out tomorrow morning from the airport. I tried to book parking (Holiday Blue, Red lot etc.) but its all sold out according to the website. However, it does mention that there are additional spots available at the parking lots, which are available in-person and not through online booking. Should I be worried about those being unavailable as well tomorrow? I'm aware its Bank Holiday Weekend so will be busy.

If so, anyone know some alternative parking places around the airport? Thank you"

"Dublin Airport Queues Hi everyone.

I hope you all are having a good night.

I know this question has been asked multiple times but I have yet to find the answer that  I need. 

I have a long haul flight the end May and I know the advice is be at the airport up to 3.5 hours. My issue is that my bus, where I live, is every 2 hours. My flight is at 15:00 but my bus will arrive at the airport either 09:40 or 11:40. I am looking to get the 11:40 but that is the approximate time and it may arrive around 12:00 or so. 

Have any of you had a flight around this time for a long haul flight? Is 3 hours before departure more than enough to be at the airport? I am just really concern as I cannot afford to miss my flight."

"Dublin airport time experiences this week? Hey - we're Canadians traveling around Ireland, visiting some family and the last leg of the trip takes us out of Ireland to Edinburgh. We're taking a coach from Galway to Dublin airport at 215am and arriving 445 - our flight is at 630am. 

Twitter @DASecuritytimes shows a pretty steady 10-30 mins through security.

We've been told 2.5 hours before the flight is best to show up but we don't really have an option to get there earlier - anybody have any experience this week with times? Is an hour 45 enough? We are NOT checking luggage - just carryon.

I know this subreddit hates these questions so I apologize but just throwing out a hail Mary before we rebook our coach for this evening and sleep at the airport for 10 hours. 

Thanks in advance!


Edit:

Pulled the trigger on a slightly earlier bus and ate the cost. Worried about roadwork/accidents or other delays since we were so tight. We now have the full 2.5 hours. Thanks for your insight!"

What electronics are allowed in carryon or checked bags? I can only find info on laptops but wondering what the rules are on stuff like electric toothbrushes and other stuff.

My assumption would be that electronics with batteries sealed inside like my electric toothbrush would need to be in carryon for safety but I can't find nothing official.   
I don't want to rock up with it and have to bin a +‚Ç¨100 toothbrush because it's not allowed.

Any info from personal experience or rules listed on websites I might have overlooked would be great thanks."

I've been looking for a house for my 4 person family in and around Dublin airport for almost 11 months now but am having no luck. Haven't even managed to get a viewing as most of the time it's already gone by the time the letting agents get back to me. We would be willing to drive 40-60 mins but still are getting nowhere, any help or suggestions would be appreciated. I'm in the situation of potentially losing my job if I can't find somewhere soon. We lost our house in Kildare due to the owners death and had to take the only house we could find which was up in the north or risk becoming homeless with two babies (I've been on maternity leave while trying to find somewhere) .
It also needs to be relatively safe, and I'm sorta clueless about the Northside when it comes to that!

"Welcome to Dublin lift from the airport to Dun Laoghaire, POI suggestions Hey everyone. I've a Portuguese friend visiting in May and I'm picking him up from the airport by car. No rush so I'd prefer to avoid the soulless over priced M50 and instead give him a little tour of a few spots between the airport and Dun Laoghaire. Any suggestions? I don't want to go waaaaay off track. Similar to the route the 16 and then the 46a might take with a few diversions, maybe sandymount instead of the n11, swing by the fancy parts of the city like Shrewsbury road, go through the city center and the Guinness store house, maybe phoenix park. That kind of thing. Not out to Blanchard's town though.

Cheers!"

"(Urgent) Airport Transit Visa I wanted to know if I can transfer between Terminal 1 and 2 without a transit visa as the airport is connected airside. My flight is next week and I have just found out about the Transit Visa system in the airport. I will be coming into Dublin via RyanAir and flying out via Norwegian so I will have to change terminals.

&#x200B;

I have already tried contacting the airport and embassies but there is either no response or I was asked to contact someone else.

&#x200B;

Edit: After much confusion, I managed to figure out that I actually do require a short term Visa for Ireland. Sadly, I could not figure another way out so I had to pay lots of money to change my flight from Dublin to Edinburgh and purchase new train tickets as well.

Anyways, thank you for the kind response, it really helped me to find some answers!

Lesson learnt: Be absolutely sure about the visa requirements of a country when booking tickets (even if you are in transit) to avoid wasting major time and money.

For anyone who might find themselves in the same situation: Please contact the authorities via this email ( [BMU@justice.ie](mailto:BMU@justice.ie)) and only listen to them (unless they ask you to contact your airlines). 

The reason why I required a Visa was because RyanAir does not offer any connecting flights. Thus, I would have to pass through immigration at Dublin airport T1 and re-enter T2 to continue on with the second leg of the journey."

"it's not just Security waits at the airport So 1st off I under why there are such issues, and everywhere is having them but I need to vent.

First after landing it took 45 minutes for them to send a Ground crew so we could disembark and get in the Airport.

Customs moved very fast for our full flight so that was nice.

Then it took another 2 hours(!) Or so for luggage to start coming on the baggage claim carousel

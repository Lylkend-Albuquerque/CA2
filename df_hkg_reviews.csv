HK protestors at the Airport yesterday 
HKFP blocked on Hong Kong airport computers. 
"What happened tonight at the airport was NOT OKAY!!! Reposting from my main because I attempted to do so from a throwaway and it got deleted. Fuck it. Hope you all are decent people.

I am literally posting from a throwaway because I am afraid you guys will label me as anything that’s “against the movement” because many things happened at the airport tonight that really does not sit well with me. I have seen many other redditors blast people for simply expressing the travelers’ POV, which is just wrong and shows such a lack of empathy for anyone that does not see the same way as you.

利申, I’m a born and raised yellow-skinned, Canto-speaking HKer, and I have been fully behind the movement since day 1. I have gone to a lot of the protests, and I literally could not sleep on 8.11 because that clip of the dude begging and apologising to the popo while being kneeled into the ground was so gut-wrenching. And ofc the eye. The fucking eye.

But that doesn’t make what happened at the airport right!

Firstly, to the folks saying that travelers should have planned better:

The travelers did not ask to be a part of this, and they had every reasonable expectation that they could still travel to HK and be alright, because in the last few days, protests have happened at the airport without flights being cancelled.

To the folks saying that complaining travelers are selfish:

A part of that is true to a certain extent, but have you seen what protesters did to travelers tonight?! They were harassed and blocked from going anywhere, chased after to prevent them from leaving, to what fucking end?! Why weren't they allowed to go anywhere??! These are INNOCENT FUCKING people, and not only is this wrong in principle, but also absolutely retarded in practice - what image do you think the media is going to see? What do you think foreign governments are going to feel once they see how we have been mistreating their citizens?

To those blasting others in this sub for expressing the travelers’ opinion:

You show an appalling lack of empathy (which is not to say that travelers who are complaining/people complaining on behalf of travelers have empathised enough with injured protesters) for others who do not share your opinion. They have been raising completely valid points with regards to how frustrated travelers must be, especially those missing a funeral, wedding, exam, or any other major event - there’s this old Aussie granny in a wheelchair that needs heart meds who is stuck in the airport!! Can you not even show a fucking modicum of sympathy for her? All you are doing is alienating everyone who was originally sympathetic to our cause, and showing how fucking tunnel-visioned you are.

About the mainland cop, I only have this post and video from Richard Scotford, a journalist who was there and who has been supportive of even the violent protesters:

"Content advice for airport leaflets I see that people are passing leaflets at the airport (smart PR move). However, the first rule of content marketing is that the content must benefit the audience. 

Therefore, I humbly suggest that the content be altered so that the headline and bulk of the content is about how to stay safe in HK during this time (protest area in the upcoming days, what gear they need just in case, what to do if tear gassed, how to read police warnings if a traveller happen upon a protest area, how to identify first aiders, traveller legal rights should they get mixed up in the protest and questioned by the police, consulate phone numbers etc). This is clearly a hot topic as evidenced by the many questions about safety we see on this subreddit. Then, a portion of the leaflet can be used to explain the protest, how they can help, as well as the 5 demands.

This increases the chance of people actually picking up the leaflets, reading it, and maybe even keeping it on hand.

I am not on lihkg or TG, so please help me share this idea if you are on those platforms.

Big hugs and farewell at Hong Kong International Airport 
Sleeping at Hong Kong Airport I'm traveling to Hong Kong in January of next year and I just realized I booked a late-night flight. I arrive around midnight and I don't know if I should book a nearby hotel/hostel or spend the night at the airport. It's my first time traveling by myself so I'm afraid to commute so late at night to Kowloon/Causeway Bay where there are cheaper accommodations. What should I do?

"Confused about connection HK airport to Zhuhai I’m traveling to HK with a side trip to Zhuhai. My plan is to take the shuttle bus from the HK airport over the bridge to Zhuhai port direct after landing. I have a pick up from the Zhuhai port.

How does it work? Do I clear the immigration to HK first? Will this be one vehicle taking me there or is there a transfer? Is this direct from the airport or do I need to make my way to the “boundary crossing facilities”? I assume the immigration to China is at Zhuhai Port, is that correct?

It sounds easy from the airport website but I’m confused about details :) There are 3 different companies listed that provide the transport, does it matter where I get the ticket?

Appreciate any first hand experiences!"
"What do you think about the Airport Which airline do you usually take? Do you think that the certain airline is “good”?(e.g: food quality and services) If you do eat in the airport before a flight, what restaurant do you fancy the most?"
"HK airport lounges Most lounges (Plaza Premium) seem to have a 2-hour maximum stay policy. How strict are they in terms of reinforcing the rule? If they are strict about it, can I choose any 2-hour block, or does it have to be 2 hours before my scheduled departure? Can I use two passes to stay for 4 hours, for example?"

"Dear Hongkongers. I've seen your apologies at the airport. I've seen your apologies on the Telegram groups. I've seen your apologies on Reddit. But you know what? You shouldn't be apologising. You should never apologise for doing something right. You are fighting for your country, your freedom, your democracy, for your rights. You should never, ever, apologise for fighting for something that's so fundamental to all of you.

Tourists are just a come-and-go chapter in your life. But your country, your home, is different. Your government didn't apologise for creating this mess in the first place and is not willing to fix it. Your police agency didn't apologise for blinding a medical professional. So why should you - who are doing the right things - do so?

You have a battle to fight. Leave the worrying to the tourists. You do yours, we'll do ours. We will understand.

Edit: My first post to be awarded gold! But then again, thank you to all the replies in this post. Rest assured that I've read through each and every single one of them, and I respect all the stance, whichever side you stand on. I do apologise (ironically) to whoever disagree with me on the need for an apology. I acknowledge that the apology from the protestors is to show that they're more respectable than the people they're protesting against, and for them to acknowledge that they have, indeed, posed some inconveniences to others, during their fight for their cause. But no matter which side of the fence all of us are on, I believe that most of us will wish the best outcome for Hong Kong, for the current situation and the future. 加油香港！"

As there's only one gantry on the HK side, I wonder if the machine can tell which direction you are travelling in? I made one trip from the Airport to HK station last week, and am going away for a weekend. I want to take the airport bus to the airport, and the train on my way back. So I need to know if I have previously used one journey on the ticket from the Airport to HK, will I be able to use the second journey on the ticket for the same direction instead of having to use it from HK back to the airport?

"Airport Express Train or Taxi? 4 adults with 4 luggage to Kowloon Hey there, asking for your insight if I should just flag a taxi at the airport to Kowloon. According to the hotel, taxi fare should only be around HKD400, so it’s cheaper than the 4 of us taking the train + bus to the hotel. What do you think? 

Also, would you know which taxi color should we take? Our hotel is in Waterloo Road, Kowloon. TIA! 🤍

"Octopus card at midnight from airport? Hello,

 I will be landing in Hong Kong around 11pm on Saturday, and I am wondering about my options to get into the city. 

I understand the mtr is available, could anyone advise whether it will be functioning closer to midnight, and whether I would be able to get an octopus card at this time, or if they accept contactless visa debit. 

Any other information regarding buses or cheap transport into the city would be appreciated. 

Thank you!"

"What Makes My Little Airport an Outlier in Hong Kong Music Scene? I've explored a bit the music scene in Hong Kong, and I've noticed that MLA stands out in several ways, almost like the opposite of pop music. For instance, their lyrics are refreshingly weird and playful compared to most Cantopop approach writing lyrics like in a literature competition. Their music genre, which can be described as twee pop and dream pop, is relatively uncommon. Despite having absolute zero mainstream media coverage, they consistently sell out multiple shows. Additionally I checked their Spotify monthly listeners with around 155k, putting them on a par with some traditional pop artists and far surpassing many other indie musicians. They also seem to have a sizeable following in China which is quite rare, so I wonder how did they become so popular in such a unfavourable  environment?"

Does anyone know if I can use any lounge to catch some sleep and how much it would cost? I suppose that it won't be a good idea to leave the airport to find a hotel. Plus with the Golden Week peak travel the hotels are probably sold out anyway.

Other ideas are appreciated too. For example maybe a spa or something similar. The incoming flight is from Chicago to Hong Kong and it's a long (15 hour) flight - I would probably be pretty exhausted. "

"Plot Twist on August 13th Hong Kong International Airport, an undercover cop instigating violence **PART ONE**

Most us are aware of the two Mainland Chinese guys beaten up in HKIA on August 13th. Most of us also condemn the violence, all violence from all sides and since then, HK protesters have came out to apologize. 

First guy is a Global Times reporter Fu GuoHao (middle age man). You will see a lot of reporting and videos on him, even here on reddit. The second guy is Xu JinYang age 23 years old. You rarely heard anything about him. Why? Because CCP does not want you to hear about him. Here's the plot twist.

As you can see from the pictures, he is dressed all in black, like any other HK protesters. The HKIA has cancelled all flights. At about 6pm, Xu JinYang instigated and encouraged the HK protesters (who were just sitting peacefully and chanting, eg: Hong Kong Add Oil) around him to charge at the Hong Kong Airport's restricted zone. Like always, several HK protesters will come up to clam the situation and dissuade people from being violent. Xu JinYang was very insistent that HK protesters follow him and charge into the restricted zone.

Then HK protesters thought... hey why are you instigating people to be violent? What is your motive? Are you an undercover cop? (just the nite before the HKPF admitted using uncover agents among protesters). People got spooked and started to surround and question him. In a recording he says he is a ""tourist"" and he is from Shenzhen, Mainland China. He is here to send off a friend (i.e. his friend is taking a flight). Xu JinYang spoke Cantonese but with an accent (He is clearly not a Hong Konger). They ask him for his Identification, he said he lost his wallet. 

They search him and his bag. The found a nunchuck, a weapon consisting of two sticks connected at one end by a short chain used by Bruce Lee and his Mainland Chinese Identification. They crossed check his ID and it says he works in Shenzhen Public Security Bureau Futian Branch (i.e. Shenzhen Police). Somewhere in the voice recording he also explains why he tried to run away... there are so many of you and you call me a cop, of course I run.

https://na.cx/i/GQjNJd3.png (shows the Bruce Lee weapon)

https://lihkg.com/thread/1462882/page/1 (LIHKG, more pics)

As stated earlier Xu JinYang got beaten up for being an undercover Mainland Chinese police instigating HK protesters to charge into a restricted zone in HKIA. You might also have heard of the US reporter who tried to shield him, Richard Scotford. 
https://www.facebook.com/567628880005099/posts/1955710974530209/?sfnsn=mo

There were also other HK protesters trying to calm the situation, saying ENOUGH! STOP! showing handsignals (X)... but there were also people who were angry and kicked him.  

According to the radio host, if the HK protesters took the bait and followed Xu JinYang's instigation to violently charged into a restricted zone of the Airport. It would be a very serious crime (much like the protesters storming into the HK Legco building on July 1st), resulting in mass arrest and justification for the HKPF to use greater violence to against the HK protesters.

(mostly in Mandarin, Taiwan)... but with original voice recording of the victims, initially you will hear in English ""I am a tourist"" that's the voice of Global Times reporter Fu GuoHao...the voice of Xu JinYang starts around 02:21 speaking Cantonese with an accent)

**EDIT:**

*Fu GuoHao, the Global Times report is actually not middle age as I initially thought, he just looks older. He is actually only 28 years old from Tianjin (Northern part of China)*

I’m due to have a long stop over in Hong Kong 17hrs in early August with my partner, we had hoped to spend the day site-seeing but that looks impossible now.

"Please help! Lost iPhone at HK International Airport (able to see it on Find My IPhone) As seen above, I lost my iPhone at HK International airport 3PM yesterday. At the moment, I can see it's exact location at Terminal 2, beside the China Travel Service (Hong Kong) Limited (on the right side outside of the airport with the three roads it says Cheong Hong Rd) and south of the taxi station there. 

I’ve already contacted +852 2182 2018, the airlines I flew with and the in person lost and found counter. They have told me to constantly check their website and they will contact me if they find it, because of that it is clear no one has handed it in yet. 

I’ve also put my phone of Lost Mode with my phone number and details to contact in both English and Cantonese. Since I can see it on Find My iPhone, yesterday it was at Terminal 1, stopped showing location after putting it on Lost Mode and said it was “picked up” then stopped showing location. Waking up today I can see it has now moved to Terminal 2 still at the airport with updates of the phone every few minutes showing that it’s just moving around the area in Terminal 2. 

I’m not sure what to do at the moment bit lost, someone specifically to contact there? And if you or anyone somehow happens to have the phone please contact me on this account ASAP!

Update: the iPhone is barely moving at the same spot at the airport, updating every few or so minutes now but still in the same spot. Not sure if a person even has but worried now as the battery may die soon and it will be the last time I can see it’s actual location or if the location on Find My iPhone is even correct.

Update 2:
Thank you all for the help and responses so far! About the ""terminal 2"" my mistake as it was showing this name on Find My iPhone for some readon before I lost the location or it went off yesterday. As one comment suggested it's also right to be suspicious and better safe than sorry! In taking thay advice, after posting this I checked my iPhone once again and saw that the phone was active at the airport showing it's location (I have two phones and both connected to one iCloud). So I took an Uber asap since this could be my last chances given if the battery runs out then there's no way for me to know for sure."

"10 Hour Layover in HK End of July 2022 - Can we leave airport? Hi all, as the title says. We are travelling from Canada with a 10 hour layover in Hong Kong. I'm wondering if it's possible to leave the airport and come back?

I've been searching everywhere online regarding covid restrictions but have been receiving confusing/lack of information. 

Any help is appreciated. Thank you

Edit: thanks for the tips everyone! It seems that this is a hard no for now. I’ll be sure to bring many forms of entertainment as it seems like many things in the airport is closed as well. Appreciate all the help - I’ll leave this open in case there’s any other travellers with a similar question."

I also read some old posts talking about travel and how a lot of stuff aren't open 24/7 anymore and etc so just wondering for reccomendations on stuff to do. Another option is just to stay in the airport for the whole time, but that would be last case scenario. Thanks for any and all help its greatly appreciated"

"How long for an airport PCR result Hello,  


I am a foreigner who is traveling to HK for tourism and to see some friends. I'm aware that I will be taking a PCR test at the airport and a further test on day 2 of my stay.  


Can anyone who has experienced this recently tell me how long it takes to get the result from the first airport PCR test?   


Also what happens if it is positive? I'm 4x vaccinated so I think I just have to stay in my hotel room for a week, but some confirmation would be helpful. Furthermore, I am planning to stay in my friend's hotel room where my name is not on the booking. Is this likely to cause issues if I do have to quarantine?  


Thanks!"

"18 hr transit at HK Airport, 12 hr rule? Hello!

I'll be arriving from Germany, and transiting through HK Airport on my way to the Philippines, on August the 1st, flying with Lufthansa. My original flight plan had me at a 3 hr layover, but due to a cancelled flight on the end of Philippine Airlines, my next flight is on the morning after, putting my layover time at 18 hours.

Looking at Cathays website, with their list of transfer requirements, the have a special note for anyone with a 12 hr+ layover to ""follow the instructions of the authorities"". I'm mostly curious what exactly will happen. If it's just isolation before transit it's fine, I can bring a book or two, but is there anything more intricate I should prepare myself for? Does anyone know? Cathay doesn't specify, and neither does the HK Airports own website.

Thank you in advance for any information

"To all those inconvenienced by the airport protest Hey all, this is just a simple opinion from a simple Canadian so do keep that in mind before continuing.

I've been trying my best to keep up with the civil unrest in HK, and I'm sure as you all know, the international airport was occupied by a civilian's protest and flights were recently shut down. 
Many have complained about their flights being cancelled, and their journeys uprooted. And to all those people, I'm really sorry, but I think ill have to say ""suck it up"".

I truly believe that currently across the Internet we have downgraded the importance or even the impact of these protests due to their nature of being called ""peaceful protests"". Of course no one will be expecting the levels of danger to be equivalent to an active warzone; However, if 1 out of every 7 people in your country is participating in this protest, you better damn sure expect disturbances or at least delays in your travels to this politically unstable region with VIDEOS popping up showing violence on both sides. 
Whether the media is skewed on either sides, what the footages across the web confirm is instability. 

Have some empathy. Try placing yourself in their shoes. 

Does it feel like you should have been on that flight? Does it feel like you had your freedom, your rights, taken away? 
Well I believe that's what they're trying to fight for: that brief moment of annoyance or inconvenience or financial burden you experienced will last a lifetime for these citizens if they do not FIGHT. 

We're all people. I'm sure there will be perfectly sound reasons justifying why your flights were important - I'm not trying to deny that - but I just want to ask: is it more important than the freedom of 7million?"
"Layover in Hong Kong for 12 hours, can I leave the airport under the current COVID-19 restriction? Hi all,

So I have a flight from Europe to Asia with 12 hours layover in Hong Kong scheduled in a few days. When I first booked the flight, I had the option to pick the 3.5 hours layover vs the 12 hours layover. I just thought that the 12 hours layover would allow me to have a short sightseeing tour of the area (visit Victoria Peak or Big Buddha, get a glimpse of the city center, etc), so I picked that one, especially since my passport allows me to enter Hong Kong without a visa (as long as I stay for < 30 days).

I, however, forgot to check about the covid 19 restriction and just found out a week ago that I would need to get a rapid test 24 hours before my departure (I'm fully vaccinated and boosted). Then they will perform another covid test at the airport. From what I read, it seems that after one gets tested, they are not required to stay at the airport to wait for the results and can continue to immigration control and enter Hong Kong.Also from this page ([https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/inbound-travel-faq.html#FAQA2](https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/inbound-travel-faq.html#FAQA2)), it looks like there's no obligation/restriction to depart Hong Kong while one is under medical surveillance unless the next destination is Macao or Mainland China (am I reading this correctly?).

So it seems like as long as I have a negative test result from the rapid test before departure, there will be no issue. I was wondering if anyone here has experienced or has any knowledge about the rules for visiting Hong Kong while on a layover, especially during the current covid-19 restriction?

Many thanks for your answers!"

"Australian Prime Minister wants Carrie Lam to listen to the Hong Kong protesters and rejects China’s ""terrorism"" claims Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has rejected Chinese claims that pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong’s international airport are “terrorists”, as tensions escalate in the global financial hub.

Officials in Beijing said the months-long protests against Chinese rule were showing the “first signs of terrorism” and threatened pro-democracy activists with severe punishment “without leniency, without mercy.”

The Australian Prime Minister said in Sydney today he wanted Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam to listen to protesters, and rejected the Chinese government’s attacks against them.

My view is one to seek to de-escalate things. To encourage the Chief Executive of Hong Kong to be listening carefully to what people are saying in Hong Kong, and to work towards a peaceful and calm resolution. That’s not the rhetoric I would certainly use to describe those events. And of course we’re concerned, Mr Morrison said.

I heard the news a few weeks ago that this was allowed, then a week later they backtracked and said ""...but not from China"". Has anyone received any further information on this? I don't particularly trust the sources I'm getting news from.

I looked on the British Airways website today and you can currently buy a ticket to Europe from Shanghai, transiting through HK. So maybe there's something going on behind the scenes? Surely they wouldn't sell a ticket if it was not permitted? 

I need to get out of China in a months time and unless China changes their flight policy (which isn't looking likely at all..), I'll be forced to buy a ticket for around £2500-3000 to get home. Transiting through HK would be a godsend, saving so much money."

Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying is being accused of misusing his power as he is said to have instructed airline staff at Hong Kong to do something that is against the airport regulations.

According to an Apple Daily report, Leung allegedly pressured Cathay Pacific Airways staff late last month to go beyond the normal rules and help Leung’s daughter with regard to some luggage.

The incident took place as the chief executive’s youngest daughter, Leung Chung-yan, 23, was preparing to board a plane for San Francisco on the morning of March 28, a source told the paper.

After the girl passed through the baggage screening area along with her mother Regina Tong Ching-yi, who was allowed to accompany her daughter in the airport as a “special person”, it was found that one of Leung Chung-yan’s carry-on bags was missing.

Apparently, the young woman had forgotten to carry it for bagging screening, leaving it outside somewhere in the airport terminal.

Regina Tong then asked Cathay staff to bring it over. However, the staff turned down the request as airport regulations require that departure procedures must be followed all over again if something has to be brought in from outside into a restricted area.

As Tong’s “insistence on receiving assistance” did not yield the desired results, the daughter called her dad for help.

CY Leung then called Cathay to demand assistance in retrieving the luggage for his daughter as soon as possible, Apple Daily cited its source as saying.

Leung is said to have even corrected a person who answered the phone to address him as “Chief Executive Leung”, rather than just “Mr. Leung”.

Informed about the situation, Airport Authority officials decided, after some discussions, to make an exception for Leung’s daughter and bring her left-behind bag into the restricted area.

The staff made it clear to Regina Tong that they were making a special exception, and that normal procedures are different.

Regina Tong then allegedly remarked that “these regulations are not correct”.

Describing the whole incident as unfortunate, Carol Ng Man-yee, secretary general of the Hong Kong Cabin Crew Federation, said no one should enjoy any privilege that goes against airport security rules.

CY Leung may have set a bad example, she said, adding that the chief executive owes a detailed explanation.

Dora Lai Yuk-sim, chairwoman of Cathay’s cabin crew union, said bringing unaccompanied baggage into the restricted zone can pose a security risk as someone can put dangerous stuff into unattended items. 

A passenger should leave the restricted area, retrieve any forgotten baggage on his or her own and go through the normal screening process again, she said.

Gary Fan Kwok-wai, a lawmaker from the Neo Democrats camp, criticized Leung and his family for seeking special privileges.

Such actions will only make the public very angry, he said.

Apple Daily cited an Airport Authority spokesperson as saying that they are looking into the alleged incident.

Leung’s office and Cathay Pacific didn’t respond to queries, the paper said.






*Whilst his actions are not on the same plane as the Ceausescus' I think his action here was plainly wrong use of his power. 

Still, the poor man is probably scared stiff of upsetting his dragonettes, no? 

To insist on being addressed as Chief Executive Leung rather than plain Mr. Leung shows a willingness to exploit his power for personal gain. 

Now, if the poor Cathay staff had perhaps had a hand in voting him into office, maybe he'd be able to insist on such a title.  But really, he is just full of himself methinks.

"Need help researching Kai Tak Airport history Hello all,

I'm a Canadian researcher looking for a little bit of help. I'm interested in the history of Kai Tak Airport. I've found a trove of photos throughout its history. Most of them from the 60s and onwards showing the iconically scary landings planes made. Those are great, but I really would like to find photos of it from WW2 when the Japanese expanded it. Those have been impossible to find. Does anyone know why those are so hard to find? Anyone have leads on where to find them (archives, libraries etc.)?   


I'm told that captured Canadian troops were used to expand the runway in WW2. Any photos of the expansion would be amazing for my project."

"Plot Twist Thickens: August 13th Hong Kong International Airport (Part Two)... There was a third **Part One can be found here:** https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cqlfq2/plot_twist_on_august_13th_hong_kong_international/
Corrections: Fu GuoHao, the Global Times report was actually not middle age as described in Part One, I thought he was, he just looks older. He is actually only 28 years old from Tianjin (Northern part of China). 

**Statement Upfront**
I am still looking for more information to support the claim that the undercover cops were trying to instigate the HK protesters to charge into a restricted zone at the airport. And I would like to reiterate again that most of us, Redditors myself included condemn the violence, all violence from all sides and it has to be noted that since then, HK protesters have came out to apologize.

A few redditors have mentioned ""two people"" (let me know if you want me to remove your reddit names)


*iamgarron: hard to tell since both guys were 'caught' at the same time, and was hard who was doing what.*


*Little_Lightbulb: They said these two guys sat down at T1 and they looked out of place as they act like they are spying on people.*


Actually the two suspicious people were **Xu JinYang (23 yo)** and **Lin ZhiWei (24 yo)**. The incident happened in Terminal 1, Departure Hall in HKIA at approximately 6pm. Fu GuoHao was not involved at this time, his incident happened much later at around midnite.

At approx 6pm there was a commotion involving the HK protesters with Xu JinYang and Lin ZhiWei (they were together) but suddenly Lin ran away and escaped, abandoning his partner Xu. While Lin was running away, he dropped his bag (which contained the nunchuck, the Bruce Lee assault weapon) and a parcel (I need to find out more info...). The Mainland ID card of Lin was also found, which explained why there were two Mainland ID cards (Lin and Xu).

https://i.lihkg.com/540/https://na.cx/i/UusC4MC.jpg (the nunchuck, aka Bruce Lee assault weapon. It was reported in China as ""sticks"". You will notice some Mainland Chinese netizens admitting to the weapon.)

Xu claims he is a tourist and denied being a cop. He says he is from Shenzhen (which explains his accent when speaking Cantonese). And his reason for coming to the HKIA was to send off a friend (i.e. the friend is a flight passenger). He was dressed all in black, looked just like any ordinary HK protester. The HKIA had already cancelled all flights. Things didn't add up and sounded suspicious, especially after HKPF the nite before admitted to using undercover cops to infiltrate the protesters, arresting and beating up protesters while pretending to be a protesters (people were confused and scared), plus a young first aid HK girl was shot in the eye and is now blind, thus the slogan An Eye for an Eye.

They managed to traced both IDs (Xu JinYang and Lin ZhiWei) working for the Shenzhen Police Futian Branch, thus concluded they were both undercover agents from China. Xu has a very distinct name, and it turns out he is the only Xu JinYang in the entire Guangdong province (formerly known as Canton province, Shenzhen is a city in Guangdong Province)
 

https://i.lihkg.com/540/https://na.cx/i/wkzh5w8.gif (a video/animated gif of ppl searching Xu JinYang's name from the Guangdong directory)

On Xu JinYang's phone, there was a WECHAT message which reads **""Everyone to the second terminal building”**. Another message, **“JinYang was caught,”** popped up, and immediately after Xu’s account was banned from the group. 

As stated in PART ONE, there were physical violence against Xu and a US reporter Richard Scotford tried to shield him. Which is all true. I just wanted to add a few more details which were left out or not too obvious. Yes, there were HK protesters assaulting him, but there were also many people: HK protesters, HK pilots, HK airport staff, HK press, HK fire fighters, HK first aid, HK people and other foreigners like Richard trying to defend and protect Xu at the various times, trying to de-escalate the situation, trying to ask people to calm down and stop assaulting him. Someone even gave Xu a fruit juice to drink. I just wanted to highlight, among all these craziness and chaos brought about by Carrie Lam and her government, there are still many HK protesters and HK people that has not lost their humanity and are still true to their cause. Thank you for those who tried to keep calm. 

Many Mainland Chinese netizens forwarded videos in group chat. However, in the media reports, the name and identity of Xu Jinyang was never mentioned. They just stated “Chinese tourists”, and later they concentrated on the news of Fu Guohao.

“Hong Kong demonstrators crowded tourists to coma” became the first topic on Weibo’s hot search topic on Tuesday night. By 3 pm on Wednesday, the number of page views reached 780 million. However, Mainland Chinese netizens continue to tag ""Chinese tourists"" and ""Xu Jinyang"" and want to get into the hot search list, but they are obviously deleted by the network management. Many Mainland Chinese netizens resorted to go to Xu Jinyang's Weibo account to leave a message to wish him peace. At present, Weibo shows that there are only 14,000 discussions on “Xu Jinyang”.

Through Baidu and Sogou searching  (Search engines in China) for ""Xu JinYang"", I also could not find any information, and it was suspected that it had been ""censored"". However, in the Google search, there are a lot of news about Xu Jinyang and some of the past information, including his appearance in the Shenzhen Public Security Bureau's auxiliary police admission list.

10:45 p.m the HK Riot police came to rescue Xu.

12:00 am then another suspicious fellow was spotted, Fu GuoHao and when confronted also claims to be a ""tourist"". There was a question asked, if he had a Press Tag/ Press ID on him. He did had several bank cards on him and a namecard of a HK police officer from the Central District Police Community Relations Officer.
